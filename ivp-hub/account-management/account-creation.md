# Account Creation

To use the iVP Hub, you have to be [logged in](login.md). However, if you do not have an account already, you can also create one right from the login window.

## Step by step:

**1.** After starting the Hub, click on the "Create an account" link at the bottom of the login window.

**2.** You will now be forwarded to a web page that will open in the default browser. Alternatively, if the link will not be opened automatically, you can also click on the "Copy link" button and open the link manually in a browser of your choice.

**3.** The web page itself will vary slightly, depending on your organization. However it is usually necessary to first state a iVP key User that will manage the iVP accounts of your organization.

**4.** In a second step, you have to add some information about you or the person that will use the new account.

5\. After finishing the process, your request will be forwarded to the iVP key user you stated earlier. If this person accepts your request you will receive an e-mail that contains your new login credentials.

Do not forget to [change your password](reset-account-password.md) after you logged in for the first time to ensure that your account cannot be compromized if someone gets access to the mail with the original credentials.
