# "Remember me"

If you have the "Remember me" option active, your login credentials will be saved and you will be logged in automatically when starting the hub.

## Turning "Remember me" on:

To stay logged in in the future, tick the "Remember me" checkbox in the login window when you start the hub.

## Turning "Remember me" off:

Through the fact that the login window will not be available when "Remember me" is active, it is necessary to toggle the options through the settings.

**1.** Click on your account name (usually your e-mail address) in the top right corner of the hub window. A list of available options will appear. Now click on "Settings".
