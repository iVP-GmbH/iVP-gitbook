# Show Full Username

By default, parts of the username / account e-mail address are masked with "\*" symbols to enhance security. However, it is possible to show the full name (e.g. if you share your computer with other users that have similar e-mail addresses).

## Step by step:

**1.** Open the settings page by clicking on your account name / e-mail address in the top right corner of the window, followed by a click on "Settings".
