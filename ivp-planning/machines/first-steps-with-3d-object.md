## Adding a new object step by step:

to add a new object, first click on one of the categories in the [library panel](./user-interface/library-panel.md).

The category will unfold into subcategories that contain objects or other subcategories. To select an object, simply click on its name.

A little preview window will open that will display the chosen object as 3D model.

If you selected the wrong object, you can change your selection by clicking on the name of another object. This makes it also possible to "browse" for objects when you can remember their visual appearance but not their exact name.
{% endhint %}

The last step is to simply click anywhere in the [2D View](./user-interface/the-2d-view.md) or the [3D View](./user-interface/the-3d-view.md). The previously selected machine will now appear in the scene at the spot you clicked and the preview window will close automatically.

From here you can either adjust [position](./move-objects.md), [rotation](rotate-objects.md#rotate-objects) or [scale](rotate-objects.md#scale-objects) of the object or [modify](customizable-machines.md) it provided it is a [customizable object](customizable-machines.md).
