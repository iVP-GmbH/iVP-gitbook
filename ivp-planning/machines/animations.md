# Animations

Many objects in iVP have animations available that can be turned on for [video production](./advanced-tools/virtual-cameras.md) or general visualization.

## Toggling the animations of single objects:

Animations are a [customization ](customizable-machines.md)that can be turned on and off in the [properties panel](./user-interface/the-properties-panel.md) provided the [selected object](select-objects.md) has an animation available.

## Toggling animations globally:

It is possible to turn on or off all animations globally without changing the animation settings of the individual objects.

{% hint style="info" %}
When animations are turned on globally only those objects will be animated that had their animation option activated previously in the [properties panel](./user-interface/the-properties-panel.md).
{% endhint %}

To toggle all animations first open the [global settings](./settings/global-settings.md) by clicking on the entry in the [text menu](./user-interface/the-top-bar.md#text-menu) or the settings button in the [top bar](./user-interface/the-top-bar.md#icons).

In the [global settings](./settings/global-settings.md) tab you can now **check or uncheck the "Animations" option**.

Alternatively you can toggle all animations via the respective entry in the [text menu](./user-interface/the-top-bar.md#text-menu) of the [top bar](./user-interface/the-top-bar.md).
