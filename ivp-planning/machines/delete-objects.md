# Delete Objects

In iVP, selected objects can be deleted by either **clicking on the delete icon** located in the [2D View toolbar](./user-interface/the-2d-view.md#the-toolbar-of-the-2D View) or by pressing the **Delete key**. Moreover it is possible by **right click on the object** in the 2D View and then selecting "Delete" from the appearing context menu.
