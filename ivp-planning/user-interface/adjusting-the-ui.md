# Adjusting The User Interface

iVPs user interface is very flexible and can be adjusted to your needs by changing panel composition, size and position.

## Resizing panels:

To resize a panel, hover the mouse pointer over its border. The pointer will turn into a double sided arrow. Now you can drag and drop the edge as you like.

## Maximizing panels:

Panels can be maximized by clicking on the icon in the top-right corner of each panel. A second click shrinks the panel back to its original size.

Panels can be moved by dragging and dropping their title bar.

## Closing panels:

Panels can be closed by clicking on the cross icon in the title bar of the panel in question.

The steps necessary to reopen a closed panel can be found on its corresponding page in this wiki. Alternatively, [layouts ](layouts.md)can be used to restore panels or whole user interface configurations.
