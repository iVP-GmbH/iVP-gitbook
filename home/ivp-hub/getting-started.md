# Getting Started

It only takes a couple of steps to install and configure the iVP Hub - and from there, it will take only minutes to bring other iVP applications to your machine.

## Quick start:

1. [Install the iVP Hub](launcher-installation.md)
2. [Create an account](account-management/account-creation.md) or [log in](account-management/login.md) if you already have login credentials
3. [Change the launcher language](settings/launcher-language.md) (if you want to - you can choose between English and German)\
4. [Activate your iVP applications](application-management/license-activation.md)
5. [Install your iVP applications](application-management/install-applications.md)
6. [Have a look at the iVP News](ivp-news.md)
That's it. From here you can continue to the pages of the [individual programs](getting-started.md#next-steps) or just start to use iVP.

## Next steps:

After everything is set up and ready to go, we recommend you to have a look at the pages of the individual applications:

* [iVP Stage](../ivp-stage.md)
