description: Easily setup the iVP Hub and get familiar with its core features.
---

It only takes a couple of steps to install and configure the iVP Hub - and from there it will take only minutes to bring other iVP applications to your machine.

## Quick start

1. [Install the iVP Hub](./hub-installation.md)
2. [Create an account](./account-management/account-creation.md) or [log in](./account-management/login.md) with your credentials
3. [Configure the iVP Hub](./settings/) to your needs
4. [Install and manage](./application-management/) your iVP applications
5. Have a look at the [iVP News](./ivp-news.md)

That's it. From here you can continue to the pages of the individual applications or just start to use and explore your iVP software.

## Next steps

After everything is set up and ready to go we recommend you to have a look at the pages of the individual applications.
