description: How to keep the hub running in the background and hide it with an icon in the Windows System Tray.

The iVP Hub can be minimized in the Windows System Tray to keep it running in the background without the need to have it opened in the windows taskbar all the time.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The iVP Hub will only be minimized to the System Tray if its window is minimized. If the window is closed it will **not** be minimized to the System Tray.
{% endhint %}

## Open the settings

Open the settings panel by clicking on your account name / e-mail address in the top right corner of the window and select the __Settings__.
