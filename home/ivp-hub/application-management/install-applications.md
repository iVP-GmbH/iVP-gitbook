If you see a grey __Redeem license__ button instead of the blue __Install__ button it means that this application has not been [activated](./license-activation.md) yet.

You can then specify where the application will be installed and if you want to have a link to it in your windows start menu. To proceed click the __Install__ button.

Although you can choose the installation folder freely we recommend you to use the default installation path.

As soon as you start the installation process the window will close and you will be back at the iVP Hub main window where you can track the progress of the download and installation process and decide to pause or stop it.
