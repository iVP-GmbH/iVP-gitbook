# Reset Or Change Password

In case you forgot your password or you want to change it, it is possible to request a reset link via your account e-mail.

## Reset password:

**1.** To reset a password, first start the iVP Hub and wait until the login window appears. At the bottom of the window, click on the "Forget your password?" link.

**2.** You will now be forwarded to a web page that will open in the default browser. Alternatively, if the link will not be opened automatically, you can also click on the "Copy link" button and open the link manually in a browser of your choice.

If the e-mail does not arrive in your inbox in a couple of minutes, you should check you spam folder.

## Change password:

To change your password, you have to take the same steps as if you [forgot your password](reset-account-password.md#reset-password). However, if you have the ["Remember me" option](../settings/remember-me-option.md) active, you might have to [log out](logout.md) first to get to the [login window](login.md).
