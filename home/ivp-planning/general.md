### Introduction

iVP Planning is the multi user virtual collaboration software for effective Building Information Modeling (BIM). Executing a project with team members from different parts of the world can be challenging and sometimes even frustrating. iVP Planning was created to eliminate the distance factor and enhance effective project execution, result evaluation and work efficiency.

### Features

* **Effective Planning:** iVP Planning provides the tools you need to plan large scale projects in real time. Whether machines, furnishings, rooms, or other products, this BIM software supplies you a library of 3D models that you have previously defined making the entire planning process easy.
* **Enhanced Visualization:** iVP Planning offers you the opportunity to execute your virtual plan using different 3D inspectors. To facilitate the process of virtual planning you get to experience and evaluate your project in a virtual environment and check whether the project corresponds precisely with what you imagined.
* **Easy Evaluation:** With iVP Planning you can evaluate the feasibility and scale of your project by getting a real-time view of every aspect, making it easy to identify and fix flaws or replace various products and parts that might not be useful in the project.
* **Project Collaboration:** iVP Planning offers you the chance to collaborate with your team and clients, discuss and make modifications to your project virtually in 3D/VR/AR, no matter the location of the team members.
* **Multi 3D Library:** iVP Planning offers you the possibility of an unlimited library of 3D models to choose from. Alongside a synchronized asset library with 3D models specifically created by iVP for your business you can extend your asset database by importing your own models.

### About

iVP Planning is a virtual planning and collaborative software designed with the focus of creating an intuitive and easy to use tool to assist architects, project managers, planners, investors and clients to achieve the best possible outcome for their projects. It helps architectural stakeholders to collaborate and plan projects down to the finest detail, no matter their physical locations. Tackling large scale projects is challenging, especially when many stakeholders are involved. Communication is always a problem leading to increased downtime and the inability to achieve the best results.

iVP Planning solves this problem by simplifying complex tasks and providing a platform where project stakeholders can collaborate in real-time with automated direct 2D/3D/VR/AR visualization. With iVP Planning architects, planners, clients, and investors can achieve faster planning, visualization, collaboration, and evaluation, which results in increased project efficiency and stakeholders' satisfaction.
