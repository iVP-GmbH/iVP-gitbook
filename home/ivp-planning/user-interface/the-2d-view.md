title: 2D View
description: The 2D View provides you with a two-dimensional representation of your concept where you can perform several transformations to edit the setup of your objects.
---

The 2D View acts as planning area where you can [place](../machines/first-steps-with-3d-object.md), [move](../machines/move-objects.md), [scale and rotate](../machines/rotate-objects.md) machines and objects as if you would work with a traditional floor plan on paper.

# The toolbar of the 2D View

The toolbar is located at the top of the panel and contains several buttons that give you quick access to 2D-specific modes, functions and settings. The one you are currently using is highlighted with a darker background.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![Regular Mode](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_regular_mode.png) | The __Regular Mode__ lets you select, drag and drop machines and objects. |
| ![Path Mode](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_path_mode.png) | The __Path Mode__ enables the [path tool](../advanced-tools/path-tool.md) which allows you to draw [measurements](../advanced-tools/path-tool.md#measurements), [fences](../advanced-tools/fence-tool.md) and [rooms](../advanced-tools/the-room-tool.md). |
| ![Place New Markup](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_place_new_markup.png) | __Place New Markup__ accesses the [markup tool mode](../machines/copy-and-delete-objects.md#copy-objects) which allows you to place markups inside your project to hightlight, annotate or comment it. |
| ![Copy](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_copy.png) | [__Copy__](../machines/copy-and-delete-objects.md#copy-objects) the selected object(s) in a specified direction next to each other. |
| ![Multi Copy](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_multi_copy.png) | [__Multi Copy__](../machines/copy-and-delete-objects.md#multi-copy-objects) the selected object(s) according to definable parameters. |
| ![Rotate Clockwise](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_rotate_clockwise.png) | __Rotate__ the selected object(s) __clockwise__ by a fixed degree that you can preset in the [settings panel](settings-panel.md#global-settings). |
| ![Rotate Counterclockwise](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_rotate_counterclockwise.png) | __Rotate__ the selected object(s) __counterclockwise__ by a fixed degree that you can preset in the [settings panel](settings-panel.md#global-settings). |
| ![Delete](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_delete.png) | [__Delete__](../machines/copy-and-delete-objects.md#delete-objects) the selected object(s). |
| ![Mirror Vertically](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_mirror_vertically.png) | [__Mirror__](../machines/rotate-objects.md#mirror-objects) the selected objects(s) __vertically__. |
| ![Mirror Horizontally](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_mirror_horizontally.png). | [__Mirror__](../machines/rotate-objects.md#mirror-objects) the selected object(s) __horizontally__. |
| ![Colorize](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_colorize.png) | [__Colorize__](../machines/highlighting-objects.md#coloring-objects) the selected object(s). |
| ![Undo](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_undo.png) | __Undo__ reverses the last action, allowing you to step back and correct mistakes. |
| ![Redo](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_redo.png) | __Redo__ restores the last action that was undone, allowing you to reapply changes. |
| ![Aspect Ratio](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_aspect_ratio.png) | __Aspect Ratio__ lets you choose a proportional relationship to apply to the window of your 2D View. |
| ![Create Screenshot](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_create_screenshot.png) | [__Create__ a __screenshot__](../advanced-tools/creating-screenshots.md) of your current 2D view. |
| ![Show Mouse Coordinates](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_show_mouse_coordinates.png) | __Show Mouse Coordinates__ lets you show/hide the [mouse coordinates](./coordinate-system.md#mouse-coordinates) in the top left corner of the panel. |                              
| ![Grid Origin](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_grid_origin.png) | __Grid Origin__ allows you to set the virtual zero or reference point of the [grid](the-grid.md) and the [coordinate system](./coordinate-system.md). |
| ![Toggle Grid](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_toggle_grid.png) | With __Toggle Grid__ you can show/hide the grid of the 2D View. |
| ![Animations On/Off Globally](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_animations_on_off_globally.png) | With __Animations on/off globally__ you can activate/deactivate all [animations](../machines/animations.md) without overwriting the animation settings for [customizable machines](../machines//customizable-machines.md). |
| ![Fullscreen](../../../.gitbook/assets/planning_2d_panel_fullscreen.png) | __Fullscreen__ sets the 2D View to fullscreen mode. |


# Camera movement

To move the camera __click and hold the middle mouse button__ while hovering over the 2D View and __move the mouse__ to adjust the camera's position.

To __zoom__ in or out use your __mousewheel__ while hovering over either the 2D View or the 3D View.

To __focus__ on a selected object press the __F__ key. It will now be centered in both the 2D View and the 3D View as well as in the [hierarchy](../getting-started/moving-the-camera.md).
