# Layouts

To quickly adjust iVPs user interface to your needs (e.g. [video production](../advanced-tools/virtual-cameras.md)) you can choose from a number of presets that will automatically adjust the [window layout](adjusting-the-ui.md).

## Switching between layouts step by step:

To switch to another layout simply click on the layout button on the [top bar](the-top-bar.md) at the top of the screen and then click on one of the layout names.

{% hint style="info" %}
The text on the layout button will change depending on the currently active layout. By default it will look like this: <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_Planning_Layout_LayoutButton.png" alt="" data-size="line">.
{% endhint %}

## Currently available layouts:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Default layout" %}
![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_Planning_UserInterface_Layout_DefaultLayout.png)

The default layout displays all the panels necessary for planning and quick [measurements](../advanced-tools/path-tool.md#measurements).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Presentation layout" %}
![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_Planning_UserInterface_Layout_PresentationLayout.png)

The presentation layout replaces the info panel through the [virtual camera panel](virtual-camera-panel.md) and the [camera list panel](camera-list-panel.md) and widens the [2D-](the-2d-view.md) and the [3D View](the-3d-view.md) so that everything is set up for the production of [screenshots ](../advanced-tools/creating-screenshots.md)and [virtual dolly shots](../advanced-tools/virtual-cameras.md).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Simple layout" %}
![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_Planning_UserInterface_Layout_SimpleLayout.png)

The simple layout is useful to display information of already existing objects and features wider [machine](the-machine-list.md) and [library panels](library-panel.md) and a large [info panel](the-info-panel.md).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2D layout" %}
![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_Planning_UserInterface_Layout_2DLayout.png)

The 2D layout focuses entirely on the [2D View](the-2d-view.md), providing a streamlined interface for planning tasks. In the top-left corner,  it can be switched to the [3D View](the-3d-view.md) to access spatial views and further planning capabilities.
{% endtab %} 

{% tab title="3D layout" %}
![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_Planning_UserInterface_Layout_3DLayout.png)

The 3D layout centers around the [3D View](the-3d-view.md), offering a spatial overview for advanced planning tasks. In the top-left corner, it can be switched to the [2D View](the-2d-view.md) to focus on floor plans or schematic views.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Custom layouts:

Custom layouts are defined by the user and can be saved for later use.

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is currently in development and will be added to iVP in the near future.
