# Hierarchy Panel

Every object that is added to an iVP project will get an associated entry in the hierarchy panel during its creation. It contains a list of all machines, objects, [DXF Imports](../advanced-tools/dxf-tool.md), [Markups](../advanced-tools/markup-tool.md), Images, [PDF Imports](../getting-started/importing-pdfs.md) and [virtual cameras](../advanced-tools/virtual-cameras.md) and is used to organize them in a tree structure. 
Via this panel it is possible to collect objects in [folders](../the-tree-view/folders.md), to [rename ](../the-tree-view/renaming-objects-and-folders.md)objects and folders, to toggle their [visibility](../the-tree-view/visibility-of-objects-and-folders.md) or to [lock ](../the-tree-view/locked-objects-and-folders.md)them to prevent unwanted changes.

# The Tree View

Every object that is added to an iVP project will get an associated entry in the hierarchy panel during its creation. These entries can be used to [select objects](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md), but are also useful when it comes to project organization. By using [folders ](folders.md)and [custom names](renaming-objects-and-folders.md) it is possible to structure large scenarios. [Locking options](locked-objects-and-folders.md) can prevent unwanted changes while a toggleable [visibility](visibility-of-objects-and-folders.md) of objects can be used remove them from view without deleting them.
