# Info Panel

The info panel displays several information about the [selected object(s)](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md#select-objects) like name, position or size and makes it possible to change these values. The panel can also contain additional options if the selected object(s) are [customizable](../machines/customizable-machines.md).

## The default fields:

* _**ID:**_ the unique ID of the object which is generated when the machine is [placed ](../machines/first-steps-with-3d-object.md)in the [2D-](the-2d-panel.md) or [3D-panel](the-3d-panel.md); the ID is unchangeable and will persist until the object is [deleted](../machines/copy-and-delete-objects.md#delete-objects)
* _**Model:**_ the model which the object uses; this information is unchangeable and independent from the object name
* _**Name:**_ the name of the object which [can be changed](../the-tree-view/renaming-objects-and-folders.md) at any time
* _**Position:**_ the [position ](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md#move-objects)of the object relative to the current [reference point](the-grid.md#adjusting-the-reference-point) of the[ coordinate system](the-grid.md) and its [rotation](../machines/scale-and-rotate-objects.md#rotate-objects) relative to its default rotation
* _**Size:**_ the dimensions of the object
