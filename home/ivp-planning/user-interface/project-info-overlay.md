# Project Info Overlay

If desired, iVP can display a project info overlay to the [floor plan](the-floor-plan.md) that will be visible on exported PDFs. This overlay can be useful to manually add additional information to the PDF after export.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently there is only a one project info overlay available. If you are interested in additional layouts, please make a [feature request](../feature-requests.md).
{% endhint %}

## &#x20;Toggle the overlay visibility step by step:

To toggle the project info visibility simply click on **View -> Project Info**.
