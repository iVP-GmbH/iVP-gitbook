  The 3D-Panel acts primarily as visualization area. Like in the 2D-panel you can place, move, scale and rotate machines and objects as if you
  would work with a traditional floor plan on paper.

# 3D-Panel

The 3D-Panel acts as a visualization area where you can work in a three dimensional representation of the room or factory. It is possible to [place](../machines/first-steps-with-3d-object.md), [move](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md), [scale](../machines/scale-objects.md) and [rotate](../machines/rotate-objects.md) machines and objects like in the 2D-panel. However, the 3D-panel also offers functions to take [screenshots ](../advanced-tools/creating-screenshots.md)or to work with [virtual cameras](virtual-camera-panel.md) to [record videos](../advanced-tools/virtual-cameras.md).

## The toolbar of the 3D-Panel:

The toolbar is located at the top of the panel and contains several buttons that give you quick access to 3D-specific functions and settings.
