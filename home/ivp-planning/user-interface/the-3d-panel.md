  The 3D-Panel allows planning just like the 2D panel. It lets you position, adjust size, and rotate machinery and objects as if you were working with a traditional paper floor plan.

# 3D-Panel

The 3D-Panel allows you to plan within a three-dimensional representation of the room or factory. You can [place](../machines/first-steps-with-3d-object.md), [move](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md), [scale and rotate](../machines/scale-and-rotate-objects.md) machines and objects. This streamlined functionality enures efficient and flexible planning.

## The toolbar of the 3D-Panel

The toolbar is located at the top of the panel and contains several buttons that give you quick access to 3D-specific functions and settings.

 ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP\_icon\_3D\_toggle_camera_mode.png)                                | Toggles the camera mode, automatically taking you to the point of view of your selected camera, and prevents general movement while the camera mode is active
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_icon_3D_selected_view.jpg)              | Allows you to switch between different [virtual cameras](virtual-camera-panel.md)                                                                                                            |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_icon_3D_move.png)                              | Switches to a mode that makes it possible to [move](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md) the selected object(s) by using the mouse|
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_icon_3D_rotate.png)                      | Switches to a mode that makes it possible to [rotate](../machines/scale-and-rotate-objects.md#rotate-objects) the selected object(s)|
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP\_icon\_3D\_scale.png)                             | Switches to a mode that makes it possible to [scale](../machines/scale-and-rotate-objects.md#scale-objects) the selected object(s)|
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_icon_3D_global_space.png)          |  Lets you change the on-screen controls that appear when you select an object between global and local space. "Global space" refers to a fixed coordinate system that isn't tied to any particular object. Its directions stay the same, no matter how objects move or rotate.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_icon_3d_field_of_view.png)          |  Lets you adjust the Field of View of the 3D-Panel's camera.
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP\_icon\_3D\_camera_reset_view.png)          |  Restores the 3D-Panel's camera to its initial default settings, similar to when you first launch the program
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP\_icon\_3D\_add_camera.png) | Adds a new [virtual camera](../advanced-tools/virtual-cameras.md) to your plan                                                                                                                           |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP\_icon\_3D\_update_camera.png)          | Adjusts the position and rotation of the selected virtual camera to match the position of the 3D-Panels camera.
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP_icon_3D_aspect-ratio.jpg)                     | Opens a drop-down menu, from which you can change the aspect ratio of the 3D-Panel (e.g. 4:3, 21:9)                                                                                                                                     |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP\_icon\_3D\_screenshot.png)                        | Takes a [screenshot](../advanced-tools/creating-screenshots.md) of the 3D-Panel                                                                                                                                        |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP\_icon\_3D\_skybox.png)          | Allows customization of your plan-file's skybox by incorporating either a cubic or panoramic image
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP\_icon\_3D\_fullscreen.png)          | Activates the fullscreen option for the 3D-Panel
