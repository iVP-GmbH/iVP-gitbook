# 2D-Panel

The 2D-Panel acts as planning area where you can [place](../machines/first-steps-with-3d-object.md), [move](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md), [scale](../machines/scale-objects.md) and [rotate](../machines/rotate-objects.md) machines and objects as if you would work with a traditional floor plan on paper.

## The toolbar of the 2D-Panel

The toolbar is located at the top of the panel and contains several buttons that give you quick access to 2D-specific functions and settings.
