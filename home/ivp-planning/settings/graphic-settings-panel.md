# Graphic Settings

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/iVP\_settings\_graphic\_settings.jpg)

The graphic settings offer several options to adjust the graphic quality and various visual aspects. They can be adjusted by using the [settings panel](../user-interface/settings-panel.md).

## The options explained

**General Quality**   
The overall graphical quality based on three presets: _Low_, _Medium_ and _High_.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Laptops** or **tablets** should usually be used with the **General Quality "Low"** and none of the graphic options below to prevent performance issues. The **General Quality "High"** is only recommended for **high-end computers** with newer graphic cards.
{% endhint %}

**Frame Rate:**   
Set the maximum frame rate. You can choose between _25_, _30_, _50_, _60_, _90_ and _unlimited_ frames per second.

* __Ambient Occlusion__ toggles ambient occlusion.
