**Laptops or tablets** should usually be used with the **General Quality "Low"** and none of the graphic options below to prevent performance issues. The **General Quality "High"** is only recommended for **high-end computers** with newer graphic cards.
{% endhint %}

* General Quality: Overall graphical quality based on presets
