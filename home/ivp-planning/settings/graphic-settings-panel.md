The graphic settings offer several options to adjust the graphic quality and different visual aspects. They can be tweaked by using the [settings panel](../user-interface/settings-panel.md).

**Laptops or tablets** should usually be used with the **General Quality "Low"** and none of the graphic options below to prevent performance issues. The **General Quality "High"** is only recommended for **high-end computers** with newer graphic cards.
{% endhint %}

## The options explained:

* General Quality: Overall graphical quality based on presets
* Frame Rate: Limits the maximum frame rate


* Ambient Occlusion: Toggles ambient occlusion
* Anti-Aliasing: Toggles anti-aliasing
* Bloom: Toggles bloom
* Shadows: Turns shadows on and off
* Vignette: Adds a vignette effect to the [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md)
* Reflections: Toggles reflections
* Texture Detiling: Reduces visible patterns that occur when using textures on large areas
