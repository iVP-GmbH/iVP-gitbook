The graphic settings offer several options to adjust the graphic quality and various visual aspects. They can be adjusted by using the [settings panel](../user-interface/settings-panel.md).

## Settings

## General Quality

The __General Quality__ option lets you quickly choose between the presets __Low__, __Medium__ or __High__ from a dropdown list to have an overall influence on the graphical quality and performance.

{% hint style="warning" %}
__Laptops__ or __tablets__ should usually be used with the General Quality __Low__ and none of the graphic options below to prevent performance issues. The General Quality __High__ is only recommended for high-end computers with dedicated graphic cards.
{% endhint %}

## Framerate

The __Framerate__ option gives you a dropdown list to set the maximum frame rate of iVP Planning. You can choose between __25__, __30__, __50__, __60__, __90__ or __unlimited__ frames per second. The higher the frame rate the visually smoother the experience.

## Ambient Occlusion

The __Ambient Occlusion__ option lets you toggle this effect that influences the realism of the ambient lighting and its interaction with surfaces.

## Anti-Aliasing

The __Anti-Aliasing__ option smoothens the edges of objects for a visually more appealing look.

## Bloom

The __Bloom__ option toggles the simulation of a bloom effect for extremely bright light sources.

## Shadows

The __Shadows__ option lets you switch object shadows on or off.

## Vignette

The __Vignette__ option adds a soft decrease of brightness in the corners of your view to simulate an effect known from photographic lenses.

## Reflections

The __Reflections__ toggles the simulation of light reflections on the surfaces of objects.

## Texture Detiling
