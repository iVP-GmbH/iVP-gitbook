# Global Settings

The global settings offer different options to adjust the [user interface](../user-interface/) and the [floor plan](../user-interface/the-floor-plan.md). They can be tweaked by using the [settings panel](../user-interface/settings-panel.md).

* Snapping Distance: Defines how close objects must be to [snap](../machines/snapping.md) to each other or to the grid when moving or placing them.
* Path Snapping Angle: Defines the angular step (in degrees) used when snapping rotation or directions along a path
* Ground plan X: Defines the ground plane size along the X-axis (in meters).
* Ground plan Y: Defines the ground plane size along the Y-axis (in meters).
* Wall Height: Defines the wall height.
* Camera Speed: Controls how fast the camera moves when navigating the scene.
* UI Scale: Adjusts the overall size of the user interface elements as a percentage of the default scale.
* Grid: shows or hides the [grid](../user-interface/the-grid.md) in the 2D view.
* Grid Origin: Shows or hides the [origin point of the grid](../user-interface/the-grid.md#grid-origin) in the 2D view.
* Animations: Toggle the [animations](../machines/animations.md) of single objects.
* Overhead View: Allows animation to be visible in the 2D view, but comes with an impact on performance.
