# Input Manager

The input manager makes it possible to change many of the [keyboard shortcuts](../keyboard-shortcuts.md) used in iVP. You can open the input manager via the [settings panel](../user-interface/settings-panel.md).

## Changing shortcuts:

To change a shortcut, simply click on the gray button on the right side of the respective entry, followed by the key you want to use as new shortcut.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some functions can have multiple shortcuts assigned, e.g. the forward movement of the camera. Other functions need two keys to be pressed at the same time, e.g. "Defocus object".
{% endhint %}
