## Settings

__Local library path__ sets the path to your local asset library.

__Use tag search__ toggles the tag search.

__Tag Search Languages__ lets you toggle the languages to include into your tag search.

{% hint style="info" %}
The currently set display language can not be excluded from the tag search.
{% endhint %}

__Foreign Tag Language Threshold__ lets you define a minimum amount of search results below which the tags of foreign languages are also included into your serch.

### Asset Databases

You can also find a list of all externally accessible asset databases you have access to showing you their __Name__, __Access Rights__ and two toggles for __Load__ and __Delete__.

__Load__ toogles the initial loading of the assets during opening the software.

__Delete__ removes the local copy of the assets from your system.
