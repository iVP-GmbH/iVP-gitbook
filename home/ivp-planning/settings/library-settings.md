# Library

The library settings provide the ability to customize your local library path, allowing you to locate and modify it as needed. Furthermore, they provide you with the option to selectively load or exclude bundles of objects within the program. Objects are grouped into bundles, meaning modifications apply to entire bundles rather than individual objects.

By "assets," it's meant collections of objects bundled together. Within the settings, you can choose whether to include or exclude these bundles. This flexibility offers several benefits. For instance, excluding certain bundles can improve program startup speed, save disk space (especially if deleted), and prevent unnecessary updates for unused assets. These options give users granular control over their library content, optimizing their experience according to their needs and preferences.

## The options explained

* Use Tag Search: Allows you to locate assets based on their assigned tags or keywords
* Tag Search Languages: Tag search languages enable searching for tags or keywords across one or multiple languages simultaneously. 
* Foreign Tag Language Threshold: When there aren't enough tags available in the primary language, the search extends to other languages based on the Foreign Language Threshold. This threshold determines when to include tags from other languages in the search results, enhancing the breadth of available information.
