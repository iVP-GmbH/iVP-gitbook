# Customizable objects

A central element of iVP are the so called "customizable objects". By offering additional customization options tailored to their specific characteristics, customizable objects can altered far beyond simple [scaling](scale-objects.md) or [rotation](rotate-objects.md).

{% hint style="success" %}
To give an example: let us assume you want to work with a machine that can have a variable number of wagons, depending on the size of its working environment. In other software the only way to work with this variability would be to stretch the machine to make it fit - an imprecise and unreliable solution that does not reflect the real situation later on. In iVP however it is enough to change a single number (= the number of the wagons) in the info panel. The machine will then be automatically adjusted to support the new number of wagons - by changing its size, by removing or adding machine parts or by swapping the whole model.\
\
Another advantage of customizable machines is that the customization can be limited to values or models that are actually realizable - everything used in iVP has a physical counterpart.

Example: the same machine with 4 wagons and 1 wagon - realized without stretching or workarounds:

## Customize objects via the info panel:

To customize a [selected object](selecting-and-moving-objects.md), have a look at the **lower part of the** [info panel](../user-interface/the-info-panel.md). The options available here depend on the object and its usage scenarios.
