# Select Objects

To interact with objects it is necessary to select them first. Only then it is possible to [move](move-objects.md), [rotate](rotate-objects.md), [scale ](scale-objects.md)or [customize ](customizable-machines.md)them. To learn more we also recommend to have a look at this iVP YouTube Tutorial.

## Selecting Objects in the 2D- and 3D-panel:

To select an object in the [2D-](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md) or [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md) it is sufficient to **click on it**.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is also possible to select multiple objects by holding the **Ctrl** key while clicking on them one after another.
{% endhint %}

In the [2D-panel](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md), you can identify selected objects by a blueish tint and a frame around the objects that displays their x- and y-size. Parts of this frame can also be used to [move](move-objects.md#moving-objects-in-the-2d-panel), [rotate ](rotate-objects.md#rotating-objects-in-the-2d-panel)or [scale ](scale-objects.md#scaling-objects-in-the-2d-panel)objects in 2D.

In the [3D-Panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md), selected Objects will have blue angle brackets around them which form a virtual box. Additionally, a handle will appear in their geometric center which can also be used to [move](move-objects.md#moving-objects-in-the-3d-panel), [rotate ](rotate-objects.md#rotating-objects-in-the-3d-panel)or [scale ](scale-objects.md#scaling-objects-in-the-3d-panel)objects in 3D.

## Selecting objects via the machine list panel:

Every object in the scene also has an entry in the [machine list panel](../user-interface/the-machine-list.md). You can select objects by **clicking on their entry**. The entries of selected machines can be identified by their blue tint.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is also possible to select multiple objects by holding the **Ctrl** key while clicking on them one after another. You can also use the **Shift** key to select a range of entries at once.
