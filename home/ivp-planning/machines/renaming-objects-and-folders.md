# Renaming Objects And Folders

In iVP, objects and folders can be renamed without limitations concerning name length or special characters like the umlauts "ä", "ü" and "ö".

{% hint style="info" %}
The name of an object is global - when it is changed in the [hierarchy panel](../user-interface/hierarchy-panel.md) it will also be changed in the [properties panel](../user-interface/the-info-panel.md) and vice versa.
{% endhint %}

## Renaming objects and folders in the hierarchy panel:

To change the name of an object or folder [select](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md) it and press the **F2** key on your keyboard. The current name in the [hierarchy panel](../user-interface/hierarchy-panel.md) will show a white background which indicates that it can be changed. Type in the new name and press **Enter**.

Alternatively it is possible to **right click on the selected object or folder** in the [hierarchy panel](../user-interface/hierarchy-panel.md) and then selecting **"Rename"** from the appearing context menu.

## Rename objects in the properties panel:

To change the name of a [selected object](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md) in the [properties panel](../user-interface/the-info-panel.md) click on the **"Name" field** and type in the new name.
