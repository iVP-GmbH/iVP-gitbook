# Copy Objects

In iVP, an object can be copied an multiplied in different ways. If several objects are selected, they will be multiplied as a group.

How to copy objects (german)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to construct fences or barriers we recommend to use the [fence tool](../advanced-tools/fence-tool.md) instead of placing and copying single elements.
{% endhint %}

## Copy via shortcut, button,  or right click:

The fastest way to copy objects is to press **Ctrl + C** after selecting the objects. Four arrows will appear. As soon as you **click one of the arrows** a copy of the selected objects will be created in that direction. Alternatively you can press **Ctrl + V** while your mouse is hovering over the 2D View. This will spawn a copy at the current position of the mouse.

{% hint style="info" %}
Although it is more precise to work in the 2D View for copying, the **Ctrl + C** / **Ctrl + V** method also works in the [3D View](../user-interface/the-3d-view.md).
{% endhint %}

You can either **click on the copy icon in the toolbar** of the [2D View](../user-interface/the-2d-view.md#the-toolbar-of-the-2D View) or **right click on a selected object in the 2D View** followed by a click on the "Copy" option.

In all cases four arrows will appear. As soon as you **click one of the arrows** a copy of the selected objects will be created in that direction.&#x20;

## Multi-copy objects in the 2D View:

To create a high number of copies in exact intervals it is possible to use the so called multi-copy function. By clicking on the respective **icon in the toolbar** of the [2D View](../user-interface/the-2d-view.md) a window can be opened that lets you set several parameters.

The parameters have the following function:

* _**Number - X:**_ the total number of elements that will exist in each row along the x-axis of the [2D View](../user-interface/the-2d-view.md) after the multiplying process
* _**Distance - X:**_ the distance between the elements of a row
* _**Number - Y:**_ the total number of elements that will exist in each column along the y-axis of the [2D View](../user-interface/the-2d-view.md) after the multiplying process
* _**Distance - Y:**_ the distance between the elements of a column

{% hint style="info" %}
It is also possible to enter **negative distance values**. By doing so it is possible to multiply elements in negative x- respective y-direction.
{% endhint %}

Finally confirm with the **dublicate button**
