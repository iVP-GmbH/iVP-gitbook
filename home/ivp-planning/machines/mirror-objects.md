# Mirror Objects

When working with asymmetrical objects it can sometimes be necessary to mirror it along its axis to adapt it to a special requirement. In iVP mirroring is possible in the [2D-panel](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md).

Currently it is only possible to mirror objects along their horizontal axis. Vertical mirroring is currently in development.

## Mirror objects in the 2D-panel:

To mirror an object in the 2D-panel select it and **press one of the two mirror buttons** located in the [2D-panel toolbar](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md#the-toolbar-of-the-2d-panel). In this way it is possible to mirror an object along two axis. Moreover it is possible to mirror it by **right clicking on the object** and then selecting "Mirror on X axis" or "Mirror on Y axis" from the appearing context menu.
