# Rotate Objects

In iVP, all objects can be rotated to adjust them to specific needs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently it is only possible to rotate objects around a vertical axis. A free rotation is currently in development.
{% endhint %}

## Rotating objects in the 2D-panel:

To rotate an object in the [2D-panel](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md) **drag and drop the arrows** near the corners of the object.

If you are using a tablet or a laptop or if you want a quick standard rotation, you can also use the **rotation buttons** in the [toolbar of the 2D-panel](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md#the-toolbar-of-the-2d-panel). The rotation amount per click can be changed in the [global settings](../settings/global-settings.md).

## Rotating objects in the 3D-panel:

To rotate an object in the [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md) first make sure that you activated the **rotation mode** by clicking on the respective button of the [3D-panel toolbar](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md#the-toolbar-of-the-3d-panel).

As soon as you are in the rotation mode, the handle in the center of the object will change to a virtual sphere represented by three circles. **Drag one of the circles** to rotate around the respective axis.

## Rotating objects via the info panel:

It is possible to rotate an object via **text input** in the [info panel](../user-interface/the-info-panel.md). The number entered in the field equals the clockwise rotation around a vertical axis.
