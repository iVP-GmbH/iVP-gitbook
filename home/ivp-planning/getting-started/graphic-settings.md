{% hint style="warning" %}
iVP is made for variety of desktop computers, laptops and tablets. If you do not use an high-end computer system with a dedicated Graphic card like Nvidia or similar, you might experience performance issues when using specific graphic options. We recommend you to have a closer look at the [Graphic Settings Page](../settings/graphic-settings-panel.md) of this wiki to learn more about the perfect settings for each device or requirement.
