# Saving Projects

In iVP it is possible to save the current project, including [machines](../machines/first-steps-with-3d-object.md), [highlights](../machines/highlighting-objects.md) and the [floor plan](../user-interface/the-floor-plan.md) used. We would recommend to have a look at this [<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/YouTube_icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/MuLt94b64O8) for a quick introduction.

## Saving projects step by step:

The current project can be saved by clicking on **File -> Save**. If the project was never saved before a new window will open that lets you chose a folder and a file name.

To save a project that was previously saved always overwrites the old file. If you want to save a copy of the current project without loosing previous versions, click on **File -> Save As**.

It is also possible to use a [shortcut ](../settings/input-manager.md)to save the current project. The default shortcut is **Ctrl + S**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to share a save file with colleagues or customers make sure they have access to all required [machine databases](broken-reference). Machine and object models are not shipped with the save files themselves!

{% hint style="danger" %}
Currently there is NO automatic save function implemented! To prevent data loss, you should save your work frequently.
