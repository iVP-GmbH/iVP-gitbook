To import a PDF click on __File__ in the text menu of the top bar and choose __Import__. An imported PDF file will be treated as any other object of your project and sorted into the project's hierarchy - meaning it can be selected, manipulated and deleted from there.

This option changes the size of the imported PDF file. You can either choose from a preset or provide a custom size for the file. You can also use the dimensions saved within the PDF file.

### Width Original File

This option displays the original width of the given PDF file in mm. It can be adjusted if the file size is not derived from the PDF file itself. In addition you can modify the overall width and scale of the PDF file to be imported.

### Scale
