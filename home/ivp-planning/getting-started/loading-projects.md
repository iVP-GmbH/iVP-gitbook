# Loading Projects

In iVP you can load previously [saved projects](saving-projects.md) for continuous work or collaboration. 

To load a project click on **File -> Open** and select a file.

{% hint style="info" %}
Project files can easily be identified by their **.plan** extension. You can move them to other folders or share them with colleagues or customers, but you should not remove or change their extension.
{% endhint %}

Before iVP actually processes the data from the file you will be asked to set some parameters that specify how the data will be loaded. The options are:

* **Replace current scene:** if checked iVP will replace the current project with the one stored in the plan.

* **Include PDF if available:** if checked iVP will import the [floor plan](../user-interface/the-floor-plan.md) stored in the plan file (if there is one). _This is a legacy option for old plan files and might not be applicable to your plan file._

* **Resize floor to saved dimensions:** adjusts the current [floor plan](../user-interface/the-floor-plan.md#adjusting-the-shape-and-size-of-the-floor-plan) to the floor size stored in the plan.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note that replacing a scene results in the deletion of the old scene content. Saved plan files remain untouched, however you will lose unsaved progress.
