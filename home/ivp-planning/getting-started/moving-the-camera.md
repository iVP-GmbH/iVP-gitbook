# Moving The Camera

iVPs user interface includes a [2D-panel](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md) and a [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md). In both of them, the camera perspective can be changed separately.

## Moving the camera in the 2D-panel:

To move the camera, **click and hold the middle mouse button** while hovering over the [2D-panel](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md). Now you can **move the mouse** to move the visible area.

## Moving the camera in the 3D-panel:

To move the camera, **click and hold the middle mouse button** while hovering over the [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md). Now you can **move the mouse** to move the visible area.

To turn the camera, **move the mouse** while holding the right mouse button. Additionally you can move the camera freely **while holding right mouse button** using [the buttons WASD and Q/E](../keyboard-shortcuts.md#3d-camera-control).

## Focusing on objects:

To focus on a selected object, press the "F" key. It will now be centered in both the [2D-](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md) and the [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md) as well as in the [hierarchy](../getting-started/moving-the-camera.md).
