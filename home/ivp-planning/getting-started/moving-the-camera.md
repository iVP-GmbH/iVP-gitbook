The User Interface of iVP Planning includes a [2D View](../user-interface/the-2d-view.md) and a [3D View](../user-interface/the-3d-view.md). In both of them the camera perspective can be changed independently.

## General camera movement

To move the camera __click and hold the middle mouse button__ while hovering over either the [2D View](../user-interface/the-2d-view.md) or the [3D View](../user-interface/the-3d-view.md) and __move the mouse__ to adjust the views on your project.

To __zoom__ in or out use your __mousewheel__ while hovering over either the 2D View or the 3D View.

To __focus__ on a selected object press the __F__ key. It will now be centered in both the 2D View and the 3D View as well as in the [hierarchy](../getting-started/moving-the-camera.md).

## 3D View camera movement

To turn the camera to another direction __move the mouse__ while __holding the right mouse button__. Additionally you can __move the camera freely__ while __holding right mouse button__ and using the [WASD and Q/E keys](../keyboard-shortcuts.md#3d-camera-control) on your keyboard.
