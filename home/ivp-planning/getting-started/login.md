# Login

{% hint style="info" %}
For better understanding we created a [<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/YouTube_icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> iVP YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYbY-axZlkE&list=PLlzoGkRUR67houzn5F5ejD3R-kQrDcps5&index=17) where you can find a detailed tutorial for the Login with  a Microsoft Azure e-mail account.
{% endhint %}

When starting iVP Planning, you will have to log in with your Microsoft-Account.  
To do so, iVP will open up a web page in your browser that will guide you through the log-in process.

The Login requires your Microsoft email adress and your Microsoft password and will show the following notice (in the same browser window) in case of a successful login:

{% hint style="info" %}
Authentication complete. You can return to the application. Feel free to close this browser tab.
{% endhint %}

Regardless wether you close the browser window or not, iVP Planning is now ready to use.

# Why do I need to login to iVP Planning?

One of the features of Version 2302 is the addition of User Management.
This means that access to iVP Software and its features have been linked to your Azure Active Directory Account.  

Therefore you only have access to iVP Planning if you log in with a valid User account. In most cases this account is provided by your company and used with Microsoft services, such as Office 365. 

# Troubleshooting

If - by chance - an error occurs, see if any of the following does apply:

## No Login Screen in iVP Planning

iVP Planning automatically opens an external browser page that guides you through the login. If no new window is opening, check if any open web browser opened a new tab. If this does however not work as intended, close your browser, restart iVP Planning and check if a web page opens up. 

## You have logged in sucessfully but no access to iVP Planning

Please check your used account for an email-invitation to iVP Planning and follow the steps in this email. Make sure to check the spam folder and contact your local administrator in case this does not resolve this issue.

## Error Message AADSTS50020

You might see this error message while logging into your Microsoft account, stating that your currently used Microsoft account does not "exist in tenant 'iVP'" (and a lot of letters and numbers).

This can happen if you are trying to log in with the wrong Microsoft Account.  
To fix this, ensure you are using the correct Microsoft Account and try again.
