{% endembed %}

## Login with your Microsoft account

When you start iVP Planning you will have to log in with your Microsoft account (usually your company e-mail address). To do so a window or tab of your default browser will be opened where you will be guided through the login process.

## Why do I need to login to iVP Planning?

One of the features of Version 2302 and updwards is the addition of User Management. This means that the access to iVP Software and its features is linked to your Azure Active Directory Account.  

Therefore you only have access to iVP Planning if you log in with a valid Microsoft account. In most cases this account is provided by your company and used with Microsoft services, such as Office 365. 

## Successful login

After you log in with your Microsoft account successfully the following notice will be displayed in the same browser window:

{% hint style="success" %}
Authentication complete. You can return to the application. Feel free to close this browser tab.
{% endhint %}

Regardless whether you close the browser window or not iVP Planning is now ready to use.

## Troubleshooting

In case an error occurs see if any of the following does apply

### No Login Screen in iVP Planning

iVP Planning automatically opens an external browser page that guides you through the login. If no new window opens check if any open web browser opened a new tab. If this does not work as intended, close your browser, restart iVP Planning and check if a web page opens up. 

### You have logged in successfully but no access to iVP Planning

Please check your Microsoft account for an email invitation to iVP Planning and follow the steps in this email. Make sure to check the spam folder and/or contact your local administrator in case you do not receive anything.

### Error Message AADSTS50020

You might see this error message while logging into your Microsoft account stating that your currently used account does not _exist in tenant 'iVP'_ - and a lot of letters and numbers.

This can happen when you try to log in with the wrong account. To fix it ensure you use the correct account (the one that got the invitation to use iVP Planning) and try again.

### There are no machines after login
