iVP Planning is the core of the iV Platform. It enables the simple, immediate representation and visualization of your planned factory or production plant in 2D/3D and VR. The application is intuitive, visually appealing, and allows even untrained persons low-threshold access. The direct planning on-site and with the customer does not only convince by an unprecedented degree of flexibility and speed.
