### Known Issues

* 2D Path selection above machine. Selecting a Path icon while it´s over or covered by a machine in 2D view will only select the machine not the path. If you’d like to select the path in this version, please select it in the Path Tab Window or hide (h) the machine for that time.&#x20;
* Video Tool Previous/Next cue. Has currently no effect while not running the timeline. &#x20;
* Camera + F. If you select a virtual camera and press F to find the camera position in the 2D/3D and Hierarchy tab the position of the camera in the 3D view is too low.&#x20;
* Path + F. It´s not possible currently to select a path/fence/room and press F to navigate to the selected path.&#x20;
* From time to time it can happen, that you automatically “multi select” multiple machines in the left machine list window. We know that this issue already, but it is indeed not that easy to fix as it is a bug in the ui framework we use since day 1. The temp solution is, to drag the “width” align (horizontal size of the machine list tab) slider of the machine list tab and just move it to the left or right for just a few mm than the machines will be de- selected. We are working on this issue.&#x20;
