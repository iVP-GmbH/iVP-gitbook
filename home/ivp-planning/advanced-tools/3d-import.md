# 3D-Import

You can import a 3D file from your personal computer into iVP Planning. To do so click on the "File" dropdown menu on the upper left side of the client, and select "Import".

{% hint style="info" %}  
For the best results, we recommend files in the [glTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF) format, which have the **.gltf** or **.glb** extension.  
{% endhint %}

Once you have selected a file, you get the option to define the files unit of measurement (mm, cm, dm, m, ft), and the direction of the up axis of the object.
Please note that the up axis of the imported object/file must match with the Up Axis you have chosen when exporting the object/file.

You will be able to change these options later via the properties panel, when selecting the imported object/file.
