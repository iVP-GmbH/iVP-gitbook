iVP Showroom is the right solution for the initial contact with a customer or their digitally supported, custom entry on, for example, your website, mobile app, or in a direct conversation. With iVP Showroom, you offer customers the opportunity to select or already configure products according to their requirements. Here, a configuration suitable for the customer can be created utilizing industry-specific predefined questions or by independently selecting parameters. All digital content comes directly from the CAD model that is uniquely integrated into iVP or is generated from it as demand-dependent derivatives.
