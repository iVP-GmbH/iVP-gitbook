**3.** Before the installation, you should have a look at the End-User License Agreement that contains all details concerning legal aspects and usage limitations. If you click on the "Next" button and continue the installation, we assume that you agree.

**4.** If desired, the iVP Hub can create a desktop shortcut on your computer so that you can start the program directly from your home screen. If you want this, tick the checkbox.

**5.** Now the iVP Hub is ready for installation. To start the process, simply click on "Install".

**7.** However you decide, the VP Hub is now installed and ready to use. You can now continue and [create an account](account-management/account-creation.md) or [log in](account-management/login.md) if you already have login credentials. After that, you will be ready to [download and use](application-management/install-applications.md) the different tools of the iVP software family. Enjoy!

{% hint style="danger" %}
When starting the hub for the first time, it might be that a firewall of your operating system (e.g. the Windows Defender) will pop up and inform you that some features of the hub have been blocked. In this case, **allow access** because the iVP Hub requires an internet connection to function.\
\
If you are setting up the hub for someone else (e.g. for a colleague) you should start the hub once to solve this issue so that the end user will not be irritated and possibly denies the required internet access.
