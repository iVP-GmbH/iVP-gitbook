# Updates

To keep all iVP applications up-to-date, the iVP Hub features a build in updater.

## iVP Hub updates:

The iVP Hub will be updated as soon as a new version is available. For that reason, you might see an update message from time to time when you start the hub.

## iVP application updates:

The automated application updates are optional so you can continue to use the application versions currently installed on your computer or tablet. However, we recommend to turn the automatic updates on because in this way you will receive new features or bug fixes on a regular basis. To activate the option, follow these steps:

**1.** Open the settings page of the iVP Hub by clicking on your account name / e-mail address in the top right corner, followed by a click on "Settings".
