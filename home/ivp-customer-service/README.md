# iVP Customer Service
It is possible to contact the iVP developers using our customer service portal. There you can submit service entries and follow their progress. Two services are currently available: Requesting a feature and reporting an issue.

To use these services, you need to sign up for the [iVP Customer Service](https://ixtenda.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1). Every iVP Key User received a personal invitation. Please follow the link in the e-mail to complete the registration process.

 **Please notice:**  Our customer portal is currently still in development and is therefore only accessible for iVP Key Users. We hope to expand the range of functions and services in the future.
